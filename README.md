# liri-node-app

In this JavaScript assingment, LIRI (like SIRI) will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives back data from Spotify (for music), Bands in Town (for concerts), and OMBD (for movies) allowing the user to input information to the command line. LIRI will display Spotify songs, search for concerts and allows the user to input different movies.
